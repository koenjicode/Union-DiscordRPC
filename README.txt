This mod requires UE4SS to be installed.
Make sure you've downloaded the pre-packaged UE4SS that is available on GameBanana.

After downloading UE4SS, place the contents of UE4SS in: <BaseDir>\UNION\Binaries\Win64
You can retrieve your base directory by going to Steam, finding Sonic Racing Crossworlds and:
- Right-clicking on the game.
- Clicking Properties
- Installed Files
- Browse
And then place the contents.

If UE4SS's dwmapi.dll is not present in the Win64 folder, you have installed UE4SS wrong.

In your UE4SS folder, you should have a mods folder. Place the UnionDiscord folder inside the Mods folder.
After placing this folder, you can launch the game.

UnionDiscord comes with a settings.lua file that you can adjust.
This allows you to adjust systems related to async updates or enable the Miku Miku Mode.

The settings.lua file is located:  <BaseDir>\UNION\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\UnionDiscord\Scripts
